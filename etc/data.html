			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Underlying Data</h1>
			<p>
				This tool is a product of the University's
				<a href="http://data.southampton.ac.uk/">Open Data Service</a>. Our aim is to make
				as much of the University's knowledge as accessible as possible.
				Consequently, this site has many supplimentary functions, other than to
				simply tell you what week of the adacemic year we are in currently.
			</p>

			<h2>Calendar Feeds</h2>
			<p>
				The following feeds are in ICS format, which can be used by most calendar
				applications, such as Google Calendar and Apple's iPhone Calendar.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Holidays Feed - Contains an event for every student vacation period for the next year.<br>
					<samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/feed/holidays.ics</samp></li>
				<li> Week Feed - Contains an event for every academic week for the next year.<br>
					<samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/feed/weeks.ics</samp></li>
				<li> Closures Feed - Contains an event for every official University closure day (staff and students).<br>
					<samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/feed/closures.ics</samp></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Other Dates</h2>
			<p>
				It is possible, by altering the URL, to display the week and term information
				for any date within the academic year, not just today. To do this, visit the URL
				as follows:
			</p>
			<p><samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/<i>[yyyy-mm-dd]</i>.html</samp></p>
			<p>So the date in a week's time would be:</p>
			<p><samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/{{ date("Y-m-d", time() + (86400 * 7)) }}.html</samp></p>

			<h2>Other Formats</h2>
			<p>
				If you're a programmer, we try to make it as simple as possible for you to build
				other tools on top of What Week Is It. We do this through the extension of the page
				called from the server. So if you wanted information about the current date
				in JSON format, you would call:
			</p>
			<p><samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/today.<i>json</i></samp></p>
			<p>
				This also works with other dates, for example:
			</p>
			<p><samp>http://whatweekisit.soton.ac.uk/{{ date("Y-m-d", time() + (86400 * 7)) }}.json</samp></p>
			<p>
				The formats we support are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> HTML - An html web page</li>
				<li> JSON - JavaScript Object Notation</li>
				<li> XML - An XML representation</li>
				<li> TTL - An RDF representation, in Turtle</li>
				<li> RDF - An RDF representation, in RDF/XML</li>
			</ul>
