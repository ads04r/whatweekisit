			<p>
				"What Week Is It?" needs some term date data in order to function. This is all available
				from the Open Data site, <a href="http://data.southampton.ac.uk/">data.soton.ac.uk</a>.
				But to make this process as easy as possible, there is a command line PHP script in the
				<samp>/bin</samp> directory that downloads the correct data into the correct place
				automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				To download the data, simply run the file <samp>./bin/download-data</samp>.
				Once you've done this, this site should then Just Work. If it doesn't,
				ensure the files <samp>current.ttl</samp> and <samp>all.ttl</samp> are present
				in the <samp>/var</samp> directory.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> The <samp>download-data</samp> script will download all the data
				and parse out the bits it doesn't need, just for reasons of efficiency. This means that at
				the end of the current semester or term, the data will be out of date, and therefore this
				process must be repeated regularly. To ensure this happens, open your crontab file
				and add a line to make the script run once a day, preferably at a quiet time such as the
				early hours of the morning.
